Introduction
==============

Recluse (Reproducible Experimentation for Computational Linguistics Use) is a set of tools for running computational linguistics experiments reproducibly.

This version contains 

* utils, which has a function for reading and writing unicode with regular or compressed text.
* article_randomiser, which reproducibly randomly divides a corpus into training, development, and test sets.
* nltk_based_segmenter_tokeniser, which does sentence segmentation and and tokenisation.
  It is optimised for Wikipedia type text, and it has a mode that preserves the untokenised text (modulo extra whitespace).
